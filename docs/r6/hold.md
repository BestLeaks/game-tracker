# Rainbow Six Siege stats on hold

It seems like UBI has closed the API during unscheduled maintenance to "mitigate the impact on their servers". They say there's no current ETA on when they'll put the APIs back online.  
That means that until they put them back online, nobody can fetch game stats.  
Source tweet from Ubi:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">To mitigate the impact on our system, we have temporarily closed the API routes gathering in-game statistics.<br>We currently do not have an ETA for their restauration.</p>&mdash; Fran√ßois R.

Because of this, none of the r6 commands is usable and I won't make them available for now.
